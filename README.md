# Basic File Explorer

The application creating by [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) is reading data from a remote source via DropBox [**REST**](https://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-api-v2-explorer/#auth_token/from_oauth1) service. You can look it and navigate files and folders.

## Needed dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface or a JDK and Android Studio.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DMihail/BasicFileExplorer.git

yarn install
```

## Step 1: Create an .env file locally

You can duplicate .env.example and name the new copy .env. Adapt the variable to your needs.
Please note that you need to fill the ACCESS_TOKEN env variable with a Personal Access Token which you can get from [**Dropbox API Explorer**](https://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-api-v2-explorer/#auth_token/from_oauth1) .

## Step 2: Start Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
cd /ios
pod install

# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
